        <h1>Project about Console</h1>
        <p>Visual Studio Code is similar to Brackets, though that it is better than Brackets. It is a platform like Brackets, with the goodiness of HTML, CSS and JS at every step. The installion of VS Code is very simple. After you have installed it, you will see for yourself the real thing. It has a left pane for files and folders, an editor to edit your HTML, CSS and JS and a title bar for opening opening folders. All just like Brackets! Oh, and before I forget, you have to install Live Server to see your website's look and its output. To install Live Server, click on the icon with 4 squares! Then, click on Live Server. Then, click on install. You can always preview your website by clicking on Go Live at the bottom of the page! Bye-bye! Thank you! 
        <p>Console.log function prints information to the console. The console is where, basically, you can see hidden information. To open the console, right click on the website and click Inspect. On the right side pane, click on Console. The console will appear on the screen. You may say, "All right, but why did you say 'hidden information'? Now, we can see it." This is a DIY! Find out why I said it.</p>
